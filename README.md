# haroldtcoach
I feel a big attachment for this project because here I learned a lot and I put it into too much love.
I started this project because I had the opportunity to workk with an amazing personal trainer and friend.
Here, I developed the website for Haroldtcoach's personal brand.
I start with a little idea of what I expect from an online personal training.
Then, I tried to show Harold's essence with the colors, shapes and typography.
It was very hard because he is a very quiet and reserved person but I think that we can change his shy personality for something mor confidence and noise.
I am so glad with the results and I can't wait to see what will happens in the future with this brand.
